# Changelog

## 0.7.5

<!-- release:start -->
### New Features

- **Microsoft Graph emulator expansion** — the Microsoft emulator now includes stateful Graph users, mail, calendar events, and OneDrive routes alongside Entra ID OAuth, OIDC, refresh tokens, and client credentials. The OpenAPI subset, manifest, seed schema, docs, and agent skill now describe the supported Graph workload surface, and tests cover delegated OAuth, app-only token exchange, local credential minting, and opt-in live Microsoft token parity.
<!-- release:end -->

## 0.7.4

### Bug Fixes

- **Local MCP packaging** — the npm `emulate` package now includes the MCP emulator in its local service registry. `createEmulator({ service: "github" })` serves the GitHub MCP OAuth metadata locally, matching the hosted Cloudflare worker, and `createEmulator({ service: "mcp" })` is available for MCP-only tests.

## 0.7.3

### New Features

- **MCP Enterprise-Managed Authorization** — the WorkOS emulator can exchange signed user subject tokens for ID-JAG assertions, and the GitHub MCP emulator advertises the ID-JAG grant profile and redeems ID-JAG assertions through the JWT bearer grant. The request ledger now captures both token exchanges so end-to-end tests can prove the enterprise-managed authorization path.

## 0.7.2

### New Features

- **MCP OAuth scope discovery** — the GitHub MCP emulator advertises configurable OAuth scopes for runtime discovery via RFC 9728 protected-resource and RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata. Seed `scopes` and `scopeSource` (`resource`, `authorization-server`, `both`, or `none`) to drive any discovery branch, including the resource-silent fallback to authorization-server metadata and an authoritative empty scope set. The hosted `/github/scope-discovery/mcp` instance deploys the fallback scenario with zero seed config.

## 0.6.0

### New Features

- **Expanded Slack emulator support** — stateful Slack writes for rich chat messages, updates, deletes, permalinks, ephemeral and scheduled messages, conversations and DMs, OAuth installs and scopes, user profiles and presence, modern file uploads, pins and bookmarks, App Home views, modals, inspector tabs, event delivery visibility, docs, and coverage matrix (#152-#164)

### Improvements

- **Slack SDK coverage** — added Slack WebClient conformance tests and route coverage for the supported Slack Web API surface (#152-#164)
- **Slack docs** — audited README, package docs, web docs, skill guidance, CLI seed output, strict scope notes, and unsupported Slack families against the implemented surface (#164)
